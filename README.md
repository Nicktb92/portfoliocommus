### Choice of Corpus

The corpus that I have chosen is one of my personally curated playlists, consisting of 406 songs. This particular playlist, called “SN”, is similarly compiled as many of Spotify’s curated playlisted in the sense that it’s not compiled based on genre but rather on a specific mood. Its intention is to be listened to when hanging out, or having dinner with friends. Specifically, I would like to know how the style of this particular playlist has evolved over the years. Did I have different ideas on what fitted the playlist two years ago as opposed to now?

Because I want to make a clear comparison between “old SN” and “new SN” and not capture a gradual change between styles, I will compare the last hundred songs with the first hundred songs of the playlist, to see if I can detect any changes in style. 

As the course progresses, I would like to extend this focus with trying to understand how Spotify provides recommended tracks based on my playlist. How similar are Spotify’s recommendations’ audio features to the ones in “SN” and which tracks would I judge to be a good (or bad) fit and why? I’ve always been fascinated with the Spotify recommendation algorithms and I would love to try and understand a little bit more how they work.

### Preliminary Analysis

Comparisons of the audio features were made between SN-new and SN-old. Overall, the style of the playlist seems to have shifted to a more upbeat sound. For example, there was a fairly large increase in valence from SN-old (*M = 0.34, sd = 0.25*) to SN-new (*M = 0.34, sd = 0.23*). The danceability feature (SN-old: *M = 0.6, sd = 0.15*; SN-new: *M = 0.67, sd = 0.15*) increased as well, underlining the trend towards a more happy sound.

The sharpest increase of a feature was found in instrumentalness (SN-old: *M = 0.35, sd = 0.34*; SN-new: *M = 0.58, sd = 0.32*). However, the high dispersion of this feature introduces some uncertainty in how meaningful this increase truly is. 

One noteworthy outlier is the song “When the Saints Go Marching In” by Don Shirley which has z-values larger than |1.5| for the danceability, valence and energy features. Listening to the song reveals why this song is such an outlier as it is a slow and melancholic piano song, which is not very typical of this overall more upbeat playlist. 

Another atypical song in the playlist is the 1997 remastered Talk Talk song “the Rainbow”. This theatrical slow-burner also scores z-values larger than |1.5| on the danceability, valence and energy features. Again, I very much agree with the Spotify algorithms that this can be considered an atypical song.
